# SPYDIRBYTE Advanced WAF Bypass Tool

The **SPYDIRBYTE Advanced WAF Bypass Tool** is a state-of-the-art framework designed for ethical hackers and penetration testers to evaluate and bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). This tool employs advanced encoding techniques, payload mutation, automated testing, and detailed reporting to simplify WAF testing during authorized security assessments.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Payload Mutation**:
  - Adds noise, obfuscation, and encoding to bypass static WAF rules.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Tests predefined SQLi, XSS, and RCE payloads with multiple bypass techniques.
- **Response Analysis**:
  - Automatically analyzes responses and logs results.
- **Report Generation**:
  - Exports results in JSON or TXT format.
- **Concurrency**:
  - Fast parallel testing using threading.
- **Optimized for Kali Linux**:
  - Built to integrate with pentesting environments like Kali Linux.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux or any Linux-based system.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or newer.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `requests`
  - `termcolor`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests termcolor
```
Arguments
```bash
-u, --url	Required. Target URL.	N/A
-m, --method	HTTP method to use (GET or POST).	GET
--auto	Automatically tests predefined payloads with various bypass techniques.	Off
--output	Output format for reports (json or txt).	json
```
Examples

1. Automated Testing with Predefined Payloads
Run automated testing against a target URL:
```bash
python waf_bypass_advanced.py -u http://example.com -m GET --auto --output json
```
This tests predefined SQLi, XSS, and RCE payloads with encoding techniques like URL, Base64, Hex, and noise. Results are saved to waf_bypass_report.json.

2. Custom payload Testing
Test a custom SQLi payload with URL encoding:
```bash
python waf_bypass_advanced.py -u http://example.com -m POST --payload "' OR 1=1 --" --technique url
```

Report
The tool generates a report in the specified format. Example JSON output:
```bash
[
    {
        "payload": "' OR 1=1 --",
        "technique": "url",
        "response_length": 512
    },
    {
        "payload": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
        "technique": "base64",
        "response_length": 404
    }
]
```
Disclaimer
```bash
This tool is intended for ethical purposes only. Use it only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Misuse of this tool is illegal and unethical.
